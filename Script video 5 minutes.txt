Welcome to this demonstration video. In the next few minutes, we'll walk you through a step-by-step process based on the flowchart you see here. This demo will cover how to use the PROMDI app to manage concession and production permits, track part numbers, and access key data. We’ll guide you through navigating the app efficiently, submitting forms, viewing master data, and monitoring the progress of each part. Let’s get started!
First, open the PROMDI app and click Go to PROMDI. Then, navigate to the Concession and Production Permit menu. From there, you’ll click on Init Form C and P to start a new form. Next, fill in the required fields, such as Part Number, Issue, and Description, which will automatically populate based on the part number. Since we are creating a production permit form, select See Attachment for the necessary details. Then, input the Quantity (Qty). The Supplier Name and Code will automatically fill out based on the part number. Move to the Previous Concession Applicable field. If this part number has been set as a concession/production permit before, fill out the required input. If not, you can skip this step. Fill out the Application Name, Submit Date, the Collins Wolverhampton Sponsor, and the Contact Person. After that, move on to the Requirements field, filling in the Actual and Variance sections, followed by the Problem Description.
Once this is done, you can upload details such as Order, Batch Number, Serial Number, and Quantity, if necessary. If there is more than one set of data, it can be added. However, since this is a production permit, we will skip this section. Answer whether all Stock/WIP in all locations has been checked. Next, address the question, Has any non-conforming product escaped from your business?, and input the necessary information. Continue by entering details under Action Taken, Additional Containment Details, and Further Investigation.

Once all fields are completed, simply hit submit this will generate ms word form.
the form can be sent via email to the customer for approval. At this point, the process has successfully passed through four key activities outlined in the flowchart: Initiating Form C and P, Generating the PROMDI Form, Creating Form C and P, and Sending the form to the customer, customer approve or receject and quality engineer receiving the response.
After sending the email and receiving approval from the customer, navigate to the Master Data menu to get an overview of the total number of concessions or production permits that are awaiting approval, open, or closed. Click the Approved Button in the system and input necessary details, such as the LUC Number, Quantity (Qty), Remaining Quantity, and Alert Quantity. The alert quantity will send a reminder or warning to the Quality Engineer that the production permit needs to be extended or has been completed. Finally, add any Remarks and hit Update to confirm.
At this point, the process has successfully passed through the next four key activities in the flowchart: QE Updates the Data in PROMDI, and PROMDI Injects the Data into FI Log.
Now, when Final Inspection checks the order number related to that part number, it will show that the part is on concession or production permit status. We can also check the master data by clicking the Master Data menu. In the Production Permit section, we can see the remaining quantity and other relevant information.
At this point, the process has passed through the flowchart stages where FI Log Shows Updated Data. The next process is that SAP will generate WIP data to track the part’s location based on the order number from PROMDI.
Finally, we can track the progress of each part number by moving the dashboard and seeing where each part is located, whether in Machine A or Machine B. Additionally, view Batch Numbers and other detailed information here.
This process shows how the PROMDI app helps manage concession and production permits efficiently. It starts by filling in key information like Part Number, Issue, and Quantity. Once the form is completed, it's sent to the customer for approval. After approval, important details like the LUC Number and Remaining Quantity are updated in the system, which then syncs with the FI Log.
Using Master Data, you can easily track the status of parts, monitor where they are in the production process (like Machine A or Machine B), and ensure everything is on track. The app also integrates with SAP to update WIP data, providing real-time visibility and helping to manage production smoothly. Alerts are set up to notify you when the production permit needs to be extended or has been completed, ensuring no steps are missed.
